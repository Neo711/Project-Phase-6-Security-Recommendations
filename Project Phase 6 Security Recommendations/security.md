# Security Recommendation

**What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?**

_Encryption for Data at Rest._

Calculator apps often store user inputs, history, or settings. Encryption ensures that any data stored by the app on the device is not easily accessible or readable if the device is compromised.

Protection against data breaches: If the app ever syncs data across devices or backs up data to a cloud service, encrypted data ensures user privacy and security.

**Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)?**

- End-users benefit as their data remains secure and private.
- Developers benefit by enhancing the trustworthiness of their app, potentially leading to increased user adoption and satisfaction.

**When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?**

This should be implemented during the development phase of the app, particularly before any user data is handled. The seriousness of data privacy today makes this a high-priority implementation.

**Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?**

Even though a calculator app might not handle sensitive information like a banking app, user trust is paramount. Implementing encryption showcases a commitment to user privacy and security.

**How do you think your recommendation could be applied?**

Data encryption can be applied by using industry-standard algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

- Implement local database encryption for storing any user data.
- If the app uses cloud services, ensure that data is encrypted before transmission and storage.

**How feasible would the implementation be?**

Implementation is highly feasible. Most modern development frameworks and languages provide libraries and tools for easy integration of encryption.

The cost and effort are minimal compared to the significant benefits in terms of security and user trust.

By focusing on encryption for data at rest, the calculator app can ensure a high level of security for any user data it handles, thereby enhancing user trust and app credibility.
